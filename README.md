# ARMV8-Assembly-Simulator
Developed a C++ program that loaded in a specified ARMv8 text file and streamed the assembly code equivalent (disassembler) to an output file. It then generated the instruction-by-instruction simulation of the ARM code by producing/printing the contents of the registers and data memories after each instructionâ€™s execution
